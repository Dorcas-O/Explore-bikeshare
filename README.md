# Explore-bikeshare-data
This project, makes use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

In this project, data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, will be used to uncover bike share usage patterns.

In this project, codes will be used to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. To also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
